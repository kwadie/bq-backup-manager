# BigQuery Backup Manager


## Overview

BigQuery Backup Manager is an open-source solution that enables BigQuery customers defining
a flexible backup strategy to all of their BigQuery folders, projects, datasets and tables
while automating the recurrent backup operations at scale. The solution offers
two backup methods for each table: [BigQuery snapshots](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/table-snapshots-intro)
and [BigQuery exports to Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/exporting-data)

The repo has been moved to the GoogleCloudPlatform GitHub Organization [GoogleCloudPlatform/bq-backup-manager](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bq-backup-manager)
